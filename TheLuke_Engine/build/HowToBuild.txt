1) Run GenerateBuild.bat to create a vs2013 folder. 
2) In vs2013 folder, open deps.sln and go to BUILD and Build Solution, or Ctrl+Shift+B, then close the solution after building.
3) Open GameProject.sln, in the Solution Explorer go to Start, right-click and "Set as StartUp Project" then you should be able to build it. 

Other notes:

When adding a component there's a few steps to follow.
1) In Start/config/EnumData.h create an entry under E_NAME(Component)
2) Then in Start/config/DefaultTypes.cpp, register into the introspection manager. See examples there.
3) In GameLogic/manager/GameLogicManager.cpp, register the component to the factory in RegisterComponents function. See examples there.
4) Bind with lua (Work in Progress)
